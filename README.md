# Things to implement:

## Core Capabilities:

-   Print tasks based on due date (soonest)
-   Human readable printing
-   Colorizing tasks based on category (like classes or <work, personal>)
    -   Want to do list
    -   Printing only tasks of a certain category
-   Subtasks
-   Recurring tasks
-   Ivy Lee method (6 daily tasks)
-   Undoing of cross operations (log file)
-   Edit tasks
-   Remove tasks

## Extras that'd be nice

-   Better input reading
    -   Perhaps interpret a line as "due date delimited" <st add -flags do the dishes 11/5/26>
-   Auto categorization based on common occurances of detected non-stopwork keywords
-   TUI interface extra application
-   Reading from a config file
-   Task completion percentage (derived from subtasks?)
-   Keeping track of crossed tasks
-   Wildcards for crossing tasks
-   Input from stdin
-   Output flags in various formats (json, yaml, human readable, others?)
-   Due dates "soon" and "eventually"
